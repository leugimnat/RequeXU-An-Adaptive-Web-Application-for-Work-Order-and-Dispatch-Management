			<p>The Physical Plant Office (PPO) is an integral part of Xavier University. They handle physical infrastructure and provide manpower for utilities and functions across the different campuses.</p>
			<p>Previous work order process dealt with paper-based processes, inherent issues with pen-and-paper, amplified by the scale of operations for different campuses, proved ample reason for better technologies and streamlining to be implemented.</p>
			<p>Features incorporated in the system include request list functions which provide accurate detailing of work order requests.</p>
			<p>Work order modules provide centralized management of different campus orientations and controlled monitoring and dispatch of manpower and resources.</p>
			<p>In-app and email notifications for push notifications as well as graphical and analytical data which encourages monitoring of work orders.</p>
			<p>Providing an accessible work order submission form without the need for manual processes, as well as a centralized dispatch and management of work orders, allows the system to facilitate and serve the students, staff, and faculty of Xavier University across all campuses.</p>
